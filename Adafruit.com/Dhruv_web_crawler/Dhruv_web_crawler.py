""" Coding Task
Build a web crawler service (RESTful APIs) to find the best sellers products in 
website https://www.adafruit.com/categories and expose these best sellers data in RESTful APIs. 
It will be better if you can add more useful APIs like the result-filter APIs. You can use any
tech stack you want to make it happen.

    Logic Flow:-  
                * The crawler fetches the master url "https://www.adafruit.com/categories" and get 35 links of various
                  categories into list. After completing that step it iterate through the list and scrap the data from 
                  the websites and store into created TABLE SCHEMA in the sqlite3.

    This name is used to find resources on the filesystem, can be used by extensions to improve debugging information

        This API opens a connection to the SQLite database file database. You can use ":memory:" to open a database 
        connection to a database that resides in RAM instead of on disk. If database is opened successfully, it returns 
        a connection object.When a database is accessed by multiple connections, and one of the processes modifies the 
        database, the SQLite database is locked until that transaction is committed. The timeout parameter specifies 
        how long the connection should wait for the lock to go away until raising an exception. The default for the 
        timeout parameter is 5.0 (five seconds).
        If given database name does not exist then this call will create the database. You can specify filename with 
        required path as well if you want to create database anywhere else except in current directory.
